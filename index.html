    <h1>Farewell Hank Aaron 87 years old</h1>
    <p>
      had a 21-season Major League Baseball career, most of that time with the
      Milwaukee (and later Atlanta) Braves. The hall of fame player hit his
      715th career home run in 1974, breaking the record Babe Ruth held for
      close to 33 years. Aaron would end his career with 755 home runs (a record
      that would hold until Barry Bonds surpassed it in 2007).
